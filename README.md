**Use Cases**

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
* [DONE] *User Story:* As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
* [DONE] *User Story:* As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
* [DONE] *User Story:* As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
* [DONE] *User Story:* As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
* Add Using Yelp info
* Adjust UI look and feel


Hint: Try using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
